    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When I was a child it was nearly 12 years of existence before I managed to secure a root beer float. I still remember my first float like it was yesterday. My neighbor was simply flabberghasted that I had never taste the pure sasparilla creamy goodness and insisted that I taste the heavenly combination right then and there. My life changed that day.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One bottle Barq's Root Beer</li>
        <li>One pint of your favorite Vanilla Icecream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 2 scoops of Vanilla Icecream to a chilled beer mug.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour your Barq's Root Beer over the icecream until it reaches the lip of the glass.</li>
        <li>Serve with a spoon and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
