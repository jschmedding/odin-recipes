    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Reibekuchen is a traditional German dish made from an abundance of potatoes. It is also known as Kartoffelpuffer or a Potato Pancake. It can be paired with a number of spices and condiments, though it is often paired with an applesauce of your choice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of potatoes</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>pinch of pepper (for savory Reibekuchen)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized egg</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel one pound of potatoes and peel one small onion.</li>
        <li>Grate the potatoes into a bowl using the grading side of a four-sided grater. Grate or finely chop the onion as well.</li>
        <li>Drain excess water from potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add one pinch of salt, pepper if desired, flour, and the egg.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together until batter is well mixed. This works best if you do it with your hands.</li>
        <li>Heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan and add two tablespoons of batter per pancake. Make sure the pancake is not too think or too large to ensure proper cooking. You probably won't be able to fit more than 2-4 pancakes into your pan at a time.</li>
        <li>Cook until both sides are golden borwn (3-4 min per side), then remove them from the pan. Put them on a paper towel or similar to allow the oil to absorb. You can place the pancakes in a preheated oven to keep them warm.</li>
        <li>repeat steps 6-7 until all batter has been used. Oil pan as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with apple sauce for a sweet taste, or sour cream, yoghurt, or quark for a savory taste.</li>
